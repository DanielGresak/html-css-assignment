    <h1 class="body-text">Training to skydive in the Wind Tunnel</h1>
    <p class="body-text">Tunnel training can be used to hone your skills much
      faster than what is possible in the sky. Tunnel time is expensive but when you compare
      the costs to recieve the same experience in the air, it does make financial sense.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">You can instant feedback on the minute body movements that
      have such a large impact on how you're flying. It also helps that you can practice
      this in a relatively safe environment. We would usually do 2 minutes at a time with
      1 or 2 minute breaks imbetween. We would then take a longer break after 15 minutes of flying. </p>
    <p class="body-text">When I was in Russia I was doing an hours training a day, and
      that would be the max I could do in a day. It is physically very exhausting as you're
      basically holding up your weight with your body. The coaches in Russia were amazing
      and with some of them being world class athletes in skydiving. </p>
    <p class="body-text">Prices around the world vary depending on local energy costs.
      In England, the cheapest you can find is around £700 an hour, but in Moscow you can find
      prices ranging between €160 to €350 an hour depending on the size of the tunnel.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Tunnel flying is also used as a seperate sport altogether,
      with competitors of all ages doing mesmorising moves in the air. It's not uncommon
      to see children as young as ten flying amazingly and pulling off moves I could only
      hope one day to do. </p>

    <p class="body-text">Below you will find a video from the largest tunnel in the world.
      The performers are both world champion skydivers named Maja Kuczynska from Poland and
      Kyra Poh from Singapore. </p>
