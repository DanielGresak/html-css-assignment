      <h1 class="body-text">Belly Flying</h1>

      <p class="body-text ">Belly flying is the first discipline that you learn. This doesn't mean that it's
        easy to do well. People spend their whole skydiving career becoming proficient in belly flying. Most people focus on formation flying which is making formations in the air with your buddies. This
        usually involves 4 people, but can have as many as you want. They have worldwide competitions where skydivers compete
        against each other in making as many formations as possible within 30 seconds</p>
      <!-- https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_mark.asp -->
      <p class="body-text">This discipline has been around for a long time and every year the competitors keep getting better.
        They usually reach speeds of around <mark>120mph (200km/h)</mark> and can get over 1 minute in freefall</p>

      <h1 class="body-text">Freeflying</h1>

      <p class="body-text">Freeflying is the main discipline that I do. It involves using your
        body to fly in positions other than belly. This includes flying with your head up (some
        times reffered to as sit-flying) or head down. There is also a subdiscipline called angle-flying
        which involves moving forward but also in an angle.</p>

      <p class="body-text"> We can reach speeds of over <mark>200mph (320km/h) </mark>as we have less wind resistance.
        For this reason we have to have an altimeter in our ear that tells us when to pull our canopy(parachute).
        We also can't look at our wrist a lot of the time where our visual altimeter usually is. </p>

      <h1 class="body-text">Bigway Flying</h1>

      <p class="body-text">This involves flying with a large group of people. The world record at the moment is 400 skydivers.
        The bigger the formation the more expertise and skill you need. People are vetted beforehand and it is not uncommon for
        skydivers to be pulled off of record attempts if the organisers think they need to improve more before attempting the formation.
      </p>

      <p class="body-text">When doing formations larger than 30 or 40 participants. the organisers will usually try
        to arrange the jump to be made from a higher altitude to give participants more time to complete the formation.
        My biggest formation has been a 14 way as I have focused more on freeflying.</p>

      <h1 class="body-text">Wingsuit Flying</h1>

      <p class="body-text">Wingsuit flying involves wearing a wingsuit or 'squirrel suit' in order to fly forward
        much faster than if you were wearing normal clothes. They can also achieve much
        more efficient flight and can fall as slow as 40mph towards the earth. I have never done this as it involves
        a big investment in gear. On top of the suit itself, you also need a canopy which is larger to make the
        deployment as safe as possible.</p>

      <p class="body-text">Wingsuiters can achieve forward speeds of up to <mark>140mph (220km
        h)</mark>.</p>
