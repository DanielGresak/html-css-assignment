    <p class="body-text">I have been skydiving since 2012 and in this time, completed around 600 jumps.
      This adventure has brought me to 5 different countries where I have jumped, trained and worked.
      I worked as a parachute packer at a busy dropzone in Australia.
      I also visited Russia where I trained in a wind tunnel. </p>

    <p class="body-text">My local dropzone is in county Ofally where I have done the majority of my jumps.
      The atmosphere there is great and they have the best facilities in Ireland. </p>

    <p class="body-text">One of the limiting factors of skydiving in Ireland is weather.
      To jump we need winds of lower than usually 20mph and no rain/thick clouds. Despite this Ireland is an
      amazing place to <a id="external-link" href="https://skydive.ie/">skydive.</a></p>
