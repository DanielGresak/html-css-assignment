      <h1 class="body-text">Australia</h1>
      <p class="body-text">I had the pleasure of jumping and living in Australia for 1.5 years.
        Here I got to experience skyidiving over beautiful landscapes and beaches
        I also worked as a parachute packer where I would pack parachutes for people doing their first jump. </p>
      <p class="body-text">I packed over 3000 parachutes here and sometimes up to 80 a day.
        This was hard work but I managed to save a lot of money which has been one of the main factors
        allowing me to return to education.</p>

      <h1 class="body-text">Russia</h1>
      <p class="body-text">Here I got to experience skydiving from Soviet planes and helicopters such as the MIL-8
        (pictured right) and the Let L-410. It was surreal skydiving somewhere with such a different culture to ourselves.
        It was customary when doing something new to buy a lot of ice cream and give it out to everyone which was cool to experience</p>
      <p class="body-text">I also trained in the tunnel in Moscow for 10 hours overall. Here I learnt a lot of freeflying
        from local instructors. </p>

      <h1 class="body-text">Algarve, Portugal</h1>
      <p class="body-text">Algarve is an amazing area to go for a skydiving holiday. They have beautiful weather
        year round and a lovely facilities. Since the area is a well known tourist destination, the restaurants and
        accomodation available are amazing. I visited in winter where the area wasn't too busy,
        so I got to enjoy Algarve without the crowds. </p>
      <p class="body-text">This dropzone is very international and has instructors and coaches from around the
        world. Making it a great place for people to learn to skydive in good weather. </p>
